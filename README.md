## About the Book
Microsoft has introduced a new globally distributed database, called Azure Cosmos DB. It is a superset of Microsoft's existing NoSQL Document DB service. Azure Cosmos DB enables you to scale throughput and storage elastically and independently across any number of Azure's geographic regions.

This book is a must-have for anyone who wants to get introduced to the world of Cosmos DB. This book will focus on building globally-distributed applications without the hassle of complex, multiple datacenter configurations. This book will shed light on how Cosmos DB offers multimodal NoSQL database capabilities in the cloud at a scale that is one product with different database engines, such as key-value, document, graph, and wide column store. We will cover detailed practical examples on how to create a CRUD application using Cosmos DB with a frontend framework of your choice. This book will empower developers to choose their favorite database engines to perform integration, along with other systems that utilize the most popular languages, such as Node.js. This book will take you through the tips and trick, of Cosmos DB deployment, management, and the security offered by Azure Cosmos DB in order to detect, prevent, and respond to database breaches.
